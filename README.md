# Install-PiAware
To install dump1090 and PiAware

For ADS-B enthusiasts wanting to use a Raspberry Pi for aircraft plotting.

Zero ideal for this project but if you want extra graphs, data bases or servers maybe the new Zero 2
or a conventional Pi may be more suitable.

This script is ideal for a new Buster-Lite system, it will update and upgrade the initial installation,
it will then install PiAware and dump1090 - it then advises how to enter a previous PiAware ID if you have one.

Just reboot and all works fine
