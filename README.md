# Install-PiAware

Installation script for Buster, Bullseye or Bookworm.

February 7 2023 updated Flightaware repository on both Buster and Bullseye scripts.

To install dump1090 and PiAware

For ADS-B enthusiasts wanting to use a Raspberry Pi for aircraft plotting.

Zero ideal for this project but if you want extra graphs, data bases or servers maybe the new Zero 2
or a conventional Pi may be more suitable.

This script is ideal for the Buster-Lite, Bullseye-lite or Bookworm-lite systems, it will update and upgrade the initial installation, it will then install PiAware and dump1090 - it then advises how to enter a previous PiAware ID if you have one.

Just reboot and all works fine
